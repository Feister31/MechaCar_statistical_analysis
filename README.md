## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* The predicted ground clearance and weight are statistically unlikely to provide a random amount of variance to the linear model. But the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD do present a random amount of variance.
* The slope of the linear model is the slope of this linear model is not considered to be zero and is smaller than the significance level of 0.05.
* The adjusted R-square value is appromixately 68% which means the model can predict the MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
* While the variance for psi is under 100 pounds per square inch. Lot 3 has a significantly higher psi which is 170 which exceeds the recommended amount therefore except for lot 3. The manufacturing data meets the design except for lot 3.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
*Using the given results we can conclude that while lot 1 and 2 are in the significance level that does not allow the rejection of the hypothesis, lot 3 falls under the significance level of 0.05 meaning that it is fair to reject that hypothesis.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition.
* Using metrics like vehicle length-weight, AWD, and spoiler angle horsepower are all good metrics to use when conducting a statistical study that can quantify how a prototype car would work in the real world.
* The null hypothesis would be whether the MechaCar will outperform today's top competitor and the alternative hypothesis can be that are the metrics in the mechaCar the result of why it is no competition to the top cars.
* Using linear regression to predict the value of a variable based on the value can be beneficial to any company that is trying to devise plans to predict future trends while using current data points.
